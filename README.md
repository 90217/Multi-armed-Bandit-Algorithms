# Multi-armed-Bandit-Algorithms
Multi-armed Bandit Algorithms in Golang.

## What is this
This is the algorithm to solve multi-armed bandit problem. <br>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit <br>


Though there are a lot of algorithms to solve this problem, I just only implemented UCB1 strategy one so far.

## How to Compile
$ go build main.go

## How to Use
$ ./main ./arms/prob.d 

## Comments
This was my first time to write code in Golang. <br>

I would like to implement another algorithm like epsilon-greedy, softmax and Thompson Sampling.
